A m x n 2D grid is given and you are standing at the topmost and leftmost cell in the grid. i.e. the cell located at (1,1). Find the number of unique paths that can be taken to reach a cell located at (m,n) from the cell located at (1,1) given that you can move downwards or rightwards only.

    Input 1: m = 3, n = 3
    Output: 6
    Input 2: m = 3, n = 2
    Output: 3
