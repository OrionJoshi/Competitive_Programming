Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Example 1:

    Input: head = [1,0,1]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:

    Input: head = [0]
    Output: 0

Example 3:

    Input: head = [1]
    Output: 1

Example 4:

    Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    Output: 18880

Example 5:

    Input: head = [0,0]
    Output: 0

Constraints:

    The Linked List is not empty.
    Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
    Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
