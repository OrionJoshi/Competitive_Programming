    Output: "c"

Example 2:

    Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
    Output: "f"

Example 3:

    Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
    Output: "f"

Constraints:

    2 <= letters.length <= 104
    letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
    letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
