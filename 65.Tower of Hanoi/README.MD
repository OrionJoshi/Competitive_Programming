Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
    3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
      Note: Transferring the top n-1 disks from source rod to Auxiliary rod can again be thought of as a fresh problem and can be solved in the same manner.
