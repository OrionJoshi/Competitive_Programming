Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).Answer the question in most efficient way.

Examples :

    Input : arr[] = {5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5}
    Output : 110

    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
    Output : 4

    Input : arr[] = {1, 20, 3}
    Output : 20
