Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

Example 1:

    Input: x = 121
    Output: true

Example 2:

    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 4:

    Input: x = -101
    Output: false
