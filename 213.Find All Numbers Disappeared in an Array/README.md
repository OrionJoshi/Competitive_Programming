Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    Output: [5,6]

Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,1]
    Output: [2]

Constraints:

    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= n

Follow up: Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space
