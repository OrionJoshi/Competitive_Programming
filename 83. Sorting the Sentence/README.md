A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

    For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".

Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

Example 1:

    Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
    Output: "This is a sentence"
    Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.

Example 2:

    Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
    Output: "Me Myself and I"
    Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers
