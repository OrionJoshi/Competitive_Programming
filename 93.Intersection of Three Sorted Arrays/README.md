Question:
Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.

Example 1:

    Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
    Output: [1,5]
    Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

Constraints:

    1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000
    1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000
