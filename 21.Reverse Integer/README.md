Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

    Input: x = 123
    Output: 321

Example 2:

    Input: x = -123
    Output: -321

Example 3:

    Input: x = 120
    Output: 21

Example 4:

    Input: x = 0
    Output: 0
