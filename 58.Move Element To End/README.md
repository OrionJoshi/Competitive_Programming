You are given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array. Return the array.
The function should mutate the input array, i.e. the operation should be performed in place, and doesn’t need to maintain the order of the integers.

Sample input

    array = [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1]
    toMove = 1

Sample Output

    [4,2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]

    Note that 4, 2, 3 doesn’t have to be ordered perfectly.
