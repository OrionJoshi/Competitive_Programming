Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

    Input: s = "Hello World"
    Output: 5

Example 2:

    Input: s = " "
    Output: 0
