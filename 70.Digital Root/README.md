Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:

    Input: num = 38
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The process is
    38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
    11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
    Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Example 2:

    Input: num = 0
    Output: 0

Constraints:

    0 <= num <= 231 - 1
