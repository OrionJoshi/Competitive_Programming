Given a string s, return the number of segments in the string.

A segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.

Example 1:

    Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

Example 2:

    Input: s = "Hello"
    Output: 1

Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 300
    s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, or one of the following characters "!@#$%^&*()_+-=',.:".
    The only space character in s is ' '.
