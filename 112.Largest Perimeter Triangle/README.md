Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,1,2]
    Output: 5

Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,2,1]
    Output: 0

Example 3:

    Input: nums = [3,2,3,4]
    Output: 10

Example 4:

    Input: nums = [3,6,2,3]
    Output: 8
