Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n _ (n - 1) _ (n - 2) _ ... _ 3 _ 2 _ 1.

Example 1:

    Input: n = 3
    Output: 0
    Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.

Example 2:

    Input: n = 5
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.

Example 3:

    Input: n = 0
    Output: 0

Constraints:

    0 <= n <= 104
