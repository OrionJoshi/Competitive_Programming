An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

Example 1:

    Input: n = 6
    Output: true
    Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3

Example 2:

    Input: n = 1
    Output: true
    Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Example 3:

    Input: n = 14
    Output: false
    Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

Constraints:

    -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
