Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
    Output: [2,4,3,1]
    Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0]
    Output: [0]
